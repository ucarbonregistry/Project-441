_______________
The Project Titled “26 MW Bagasse based Co-generation by “M/s Sahakar Maharshi
Shivajirao Narayanrao Nagawade Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd.” is a bagasse-based CoGeneration (co- gen) Power Project successfully commissioned by Maharashtra State
Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL) and operational since 28/08/2019.
The Project is owned by M/s Sahakar Maharshi Shivajirao Narayanrao Nagawade Sahakari
Sakhar Karkhana Ltd. (hereby to be called as Project Proponent, PP).
____________________
The PP has set up an integrated new sugar mill with sugar crushing capacity of 5000 TCD and
installs 26 MW commissioning on 28/08/2019 Bagasse based Cogeneration power plant. This
will remove the dependency of the sugar mill on the power supplied from the state grid.
Power generated from this project activity will be used for meeting plant requirement. After
fulfilling its captive energy requirement, remaining power will be sold to the state grid as per
the Power Purchase Agreement.
___________________
The Co-gen power project of 26 MW capacity will operate on bagasse only for 120 to140
days during season days. Actual number of mill operation days will be mentioned in the
monitoring period. At designed level, the project will generate clean energy and after meeting
the captive requirement export the surplus energy to Maharashtra State Electricity
Transmission Company Limited (MSEDCL). All the steam and power requirements of the
sugar mill and co-gen power plant will be met internally from the project itself.
________________
The purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity using renewable biomass (i.e.
Bagasse) and thereby reduce GHG emissions by displacing the fossil fuel dominated grid
based electricity with biomass based renewable electricity. The electricity produced by the
project is directly contributing to climate change mitigation by reducing the anthropogenic
emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere by displacing an equivalent
amount of fossil power at grid. Hence, project activity is displacing the estimated annual net
electricity generation i.e., 19,000 MWh/yr from the Indian grid system, which otherwise
would have been generated by the operation of fossil fuel-based grid-connected power
plants. The project activity doesn’t involve any GHG emission sources. The estimated annual
CO2e emission reductions by the project activity are expected to be 15,336 tCO2e/yr,
whereas actual emission reductions achieved during the first CoU period shall be submitted
as a part of first monitoring and verification.
The project activity employs 26 MW aggregated generator along with a boiler of 140 TPH
with high pressure and temperature configuration (87Kg/Cm², 515°C).
